# Welcome to Mike Island 🏝️

Unlike many sites on the internet, there is little expectation of vacationers stopping by this island.

On the off chance that you're lost...Welcome 👋

What you'll find here.

* A blog
* Links & resources
* Walk-through of side projects

The primary focus will be on building w/ ML (I'm becoming old school by not using AI) and software in general.

## A little about me

Based on the titular island, you know my name is Mike.

* Live in KC w/ my wife, son and soon a daughter too
* Work in data science / data eng + know enough frontend to be dangerous
* Will turn anything into a game that can be won (winning is great, losing is awful)

I have twitter (X) but don't tweet (Xeet?). Have linkedin...and believe first stage of "f you" money is not having linkedin. So...email is preferred :)
