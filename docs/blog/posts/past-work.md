Here is a non-exhaustive overview of work I've done with ML & AI.

### A Disclaimer of Sorts
Each of these projects was a unique problem based on the business, data availablity & amount, and other constraints.

We can operate within most constraints but not all.

Additional note, examples are framed in a business context. Most projects were done end-to-end -> data prep & cleaning, problem definition, model training, evaluation, deployment & monitoring.

### Pricing & Inventory
Promotion Pricing Optimization:
* What: Model that predicted the item(s) most receptive to promotion + the optimal discount for sales and margin dollars.
* Value: Drives better return on promotionala dollars, increases sales or margin dollars.

Inventory Optimization:
* What: Suggest optimal order volume to meet demand of promoted items.
* Value: Minimize lost sales from out of stock items and lost inventory from over ordering.

### Marketing & Sales
Match acquisition cost and customer lifetime value
* What: A Google adwords bidding model that identified amount to bid that maximized customer acquisition at acceptable customer lifetime value threshold.
* Value: Allowed business a controlled way to grow customers without getting "upside down" on return on ad spend.

Lead Scoring & Allocation:
* What: Identify prospects with highest conversion likelihood and paired prospect with "best fit" sales rep.
* Value: Doubled sales conversion at end of three month "calibration" period.

### General
Text to SQL: 
* What: User asks natural question like "what was my top selling product last week?" to a SQL query (and data output) tool.
* Value: Enables business to be better informed without relying on technical resources for answers.

Impact of user action:
* What: User books a service today, what value does this create over the next three months relative to a similar user who doesn't book a service today?
* Value: Improves understanding of quality of service provided and enables better planning.
